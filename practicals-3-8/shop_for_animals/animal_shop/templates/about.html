      <p>Born from the collision of sugar, serotonin, and sass, Soma Animals began as an experiment to see what would happen if joy were a snack. It worked.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card corner-tag">
      <h2 class="logo-text">ðŸŽ¨ Flavors of Feelings</h2>
      <p>Each Soma Animal snack is a pastel-colored, texture-popping, emotionally ambiguous treat. Expect spontaneous feelings like: gentle nostalgia, "is this a dream?" and mild euphoria.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="card corner-tag">
      <h2 class="logo-text">ðŸ§ƒ Powered by Vibes</h2>
      <p>We donâ€™t use preservatives, just pure vibes. Crafted in a tiny lab run by plush toys and eldritch pastel frogs. Every bite radiates aesthetic intent.</p>

    <h2 class="logo-text">ðŸŒˆ We Donâ€™t Just Sell Snacks</h2>
    <p>We sell experiences. Moments. Little boxes of edible stories. Because why snack on reality when you can taste the dream?</p>
    <p><em>"Side effects may include: giggles, color hallucinations, and deeply personal flashbacks."</em></p>
